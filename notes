Stochastic environment
For bid distribution of other players we can use uniform distribution in [0,1]
For user's demand curve we can use 1-price after price normalization


We can use the PricingEnvironment in lab3 for pricing in stochastic environment with n_t = 1 constant
Pricing algorithm GP-UCB

Bidding environment we use SecondPriceAuction in lab4
# simple scenario: competitors sample bids from a uniform 
other_bids = np.random.uniform(0, 10*B/n_users, size = (n_advertisers, n_users))


Budget pacing as the primal-dual algorithm ==> MultiplicativePacingAgent
UCB-like algorithm for non-truthful auctions used for second price auctions

What is meant for primaml-dual algorithm?
Do all the users have the same demand curve (the one we have to learn with GP)?
Can we use the UCB-like algorithm for non-trutful auctions for second price auctions?
